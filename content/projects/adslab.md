## Description
It took nearly 5 months to complete 8 data science projects. From the first project to the last, I learned about various aspects and tools of data science. Furthermore, I've experimented with several components of the project locally for my own enjoyment.

This covers:  
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis  
âœ… Data Wrangling  
âœ… Data Visualization  
âœ… Work with Imbalanced data using resampling  
âœ… Python OOP  
âœ… MongoDB  
âœ… SQL  
âœ… API (FastAPI)  
âœ… Classification and Regression Models  
âœ… Time-series Data and GARCH model  
âœ… Model Deployment in Web

I've included a few core methods that I've learned from the entire Applied Data Science Lab. I especially want to thank Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody, who has such an amazing way of teaching with both fun and knowledge, as well as WorldQuant University for providing us with this opportunity for free.
